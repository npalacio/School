I think I would want % of covid tests positive by county, city?

Covid tracking project: https://covidtracking.com/data
-visualization guide: https://covidtracking.com/about-data/visualization-guide
-can only provide data at state level
    -I would prefer city/county level

NY Times: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
-data is in CSV files on Github that you can download for free
-has county level data
-has total confirmed cases and probable cases
    -some places only report confirmed cases
-they count cases where patient is treated, not necessarily where they live
-are cases for a county cumulative in their data or just cases reported on that date?
    -in state dataset it looks cumulative
    -documentation says it is cumulative
        -when a state/county does not show up on a date that means there were 0 new cases/deaths on that day
    -I think I need to know how many new people were infected daily at the county level, could probably calculate this from their data

John Hopkins: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data
-says they use Covid Tracking Project and their own repo
    -repo: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
        -this has daily counts of confirmed cases and deaths reported at county level
        -has files broken out by day as well
            -every locations counts for just this day

CDC: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days
-has anonymous patient records but no location with them
-has restricted dataset with county of patients, have to apply for access: https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Restricted-Access-Detai/mbd7-r32t
    -9. All publications and/or presentations using the restricted access data must include the following disclaimer: "The CDC does not take responsibility for the scientific validity or accuracy of methodology, results, statistical analyses, or conclusions presented."
    -10. For oral or written presentations or publications, the source of the data must be attributed to the CDC: â€œCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 Response. COVID-19 Case Surveillance Data Access, Summary, and Limitations (version date)" (Please check the GitHub project to include the version date of the dataset that you used for the publication.)
-thinking I would use this dataset as a last resort, I dont really need individual patient records, just rolled up to county level
