first pass
-inference rule = branch it off a claim, says that if I can prove this other sub claim then that proves this claim

-gut check on argument
    -have we identified all relevant sub claims?
    -is the evidence sufficient and robust?
    -is the argument strong and logical?
-assurance increases as doubts are eliminated
-when trying to find all sub claims
    -attack claims using rebutting defeater (why claim would be false)
    -attack evidence (undermining defeater) - why evidence is irrelevant or insufficient
    -attack inference (undercutting defeater) - why logic of argument is not sound
-confidence measured by ratio of doubts removed to total doubts (Baconian probability)
