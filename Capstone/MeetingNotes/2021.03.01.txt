Stuff I got done
-worked on proposal intro (background and motivation) and related work

Questions I have
-can I sign that doc with weather source?
-is there a template for my proposal document I should follow?
-wondering how specific I need to be in my project proposal?

Meeting notes
-make sure weather source knows I am not signing on behalf of university
    -should only be signing on behalf of myself
-leaning towards sending complete sections of proposal for review
    -send in word
-proposal
    -I have a motivating question and a plan for investigating
    -mockups of UI would not hurt
        -ex: want to communicate an interaction technique based on literature
        -story board for how it would work
    -'If I do this, is it likely to succeed'
    -template:
        -no strict policy on format
            -APA citations?
        -sections: intro, related work, method/approach (what it is, how it works, data sources, techniques to visualize), proposed design,
        timeline for deliverables (Gant chart)
-word plugin for Zotero?
    -https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_integration

What I will do next
-outline for sections
    -related work
        -influenze
        -weather on covid potential impact
        -public awareness
            -talk about audience and best way to format their info
