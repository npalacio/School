Introduction
-COVID timeline
-How it spreads
-Why weather
    -There is precedence to think that the COVID-19 virus spreads more easily in colder, dryer weather.
        -It is well established that influenza spread is influenced by the weather.
        -Specifically, temperature, humidity and daily variation of both of these have been found to have a significant impact on influenza infection rates
        -While the coronavirus is certainly not the same thing as the flu it does spread in a very similar manner. This alone makes the relationship between COVID-19 transmission and the weather worth exploring.
    -There has been some research published already exploring the relationship between weather and COVID. However, results from these studies have been mixed.
        -One literature review published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public health analyzed the current available literature on the association between weather and COVID-19 incidence. This study concluded that weather does in fact play a significant role in COVID-19 transmission. Specifically, it said temperature and humidity were found to be the most common weather factors associated with COVID-19 transmission.
        -Another study published in the same journal highlighted an issue with the existing research on COVID-19 and weather. It said that existing research on this association only considers weather variables during analysis. This study concluded that weather on its own was a non-influential factor in COVID-19 transmission. Instead, said that other factors such as urban density and mobility of the population influenced COVID-19 transmission much more than weather.
        -One limitation of both of these studies in the data that they both had to work with. The first research article discussed was received for peer review in November 2020. The second article was received in September 2020. This means that both articles were working with limited COVID-19 data, specifically missing out on spikes that were seen in the United States during the November - January time frame.
        -These articles highlight the need for continued exploration of the relationship between COVID-19 and the weather.
-Describe project
    -map based web app with visualizations for COVID and weather together
    -intended audience: Middle school scientists
    -Purpose: Allow students to investigate weather's role in COVID-19 transmission by interacting with a visualization tool
        -Kids would be able to link what they are learning in school to what is happening in the world today
    -Features:
        -allow users to input location (county), date range and what charts they would like to see
            -Charts would share the input date range
        -allow users to input lag between weather and covid data
            -this would represent incubation period of virus
        -What other configurable things should there be about the visualization?

Methods
-it is a web app
    -accessible to everyone
-it is map based (location centric)
    -the effect of weather could vary based on the area of interest
-data sources
    -COVID: NY Times
        -hosted on GitHub
        -CSV format
        -has cumulative COVID infections by county for US
    -Weather: Weather source
        -paid API
            -free access to researchers looking into weather and COVID
        -can view daily, hourly weather history by ZIP code or lat/long
-data preparation
    -can calculate new daily infections by county
    -weather data can be queried by lat/long using centroid of US counties
    -Inputs: US county, begin date, end date
    -Output:
        -chart with time on x-axis
        -weather data on y1 (with 1 week lag)
            -average weekly temperature
                -average weekly absolute humidity? average weekly relative humidity? Would need another axis for these. Should I plot these in separate charts?
        -covid data on y2
            -average weekly infection rate (new infections per week)
        -just start with first day of range, for every 7 days:
            -sum up daily new infections = new infections that week
                -or should I calculate average infections/day for that week?
            -calculate average temperature for that week
    -data definitions
        -average weekly temperature (avgWeeklyTemp) = (tempDay1 + tempDay2 + ... + tempDay7)/7
        -average absolute humidity temperature = (absHumDay1 + absHumDay2 + ... + absHumDay7)/7
        -average relative humidity temperature = (relHumDay1 + relHumDay2 + ... + relHumDay7)/7
        -weekly relative variation of temp = avgWeeklyTempWeek2 - avgWeeklyTempWeek1
        -weekly absolute variation of temp = |avgWeeklyTempWeek2 - avgWeeklyTempWeek1|
        -average weekly infections = (newInfectionsDay1 + newInfectionsDay2 + ... + newInfectionsDay7)/7
-data visualization
    -core pieces:
        -a map where a user can pick a county of interest
        -somewhere to input a date range from user
        -charts for:
            -weekly COVID infections
            -weekly average temp
            -weekly average abs humidity
            -weekly relative variation of temp
    -Questions:
        -Probably pick 2 weather charts to start with?
            -Temp, absolute humidity
        -Should the map be symbolized using any of this data?
            -Would be cool if counties with a strong correlation of COVID to weather were symbolized differently but not sure how I would do that
            -seems like a nice to have?
        -How to best visualize COVID and weather datasets?
            -Current best idea is separate charts because these data points all have different scales
            -Charts could share user interactions
                -user hovers on 1 and tooltip shows on all of them?
        -Could only show charts once a county is selected
            -seems like a nice to have?
