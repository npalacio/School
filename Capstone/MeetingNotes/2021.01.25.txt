Stuff I got done
-browsed some research papers
-looking into open weather api
    -I might have to make this work with a subset of locations that I preselect
    -emailed them asking what I could get access to for free as a student, I think I need bulk history data

Questions I have
-Do I have a budget?
    -Could I build this stuff to run in Azure?

What I will do next
