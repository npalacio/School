Background
-refresher
    -Some of you might remember when this pandemic began last spring some people said this would all just 'go away' with warmer weather...
    -While we know that this did not all just 'go away', people were bringing this up because weather's effect on the season flu is actually well established.
    -There was a study done in France in 2016 that looked at weather's role on seasonal influenza spread (Roussel et al., 2016)
        -This study found that a couple groups of weather variables had an impact of influenza spread
            -The first group was temperature, aboslute humidity and daily variation of aboslute humidity
            -The second group was sunshine duration, relative humidity and daily variation of relative humidity
            -The impact of these groups of weather variables was found to be between 3% - 6%, so relatively low but still there
            -This study mentioned that their results were consistent with similar studies in other parts of the world where a weather impact on influenza spread was found to be a few percent as well
    -There have been a few studies this last year looking at weather's role in the COVID-19 pandemic
        -Results have been mixed
        -One literature review summarized the work of 23 studies that investigated the relationship between COVID-19 transmission and different weather variables (McClymont & Hu, 2021)
            -This literature review found that most studies who looked at temperature or humidity found a correlation with COVID-19 transmission\
            -However, some reported a positive correlation while others reported a negative correlation
    -Another study published in the same journal highlighted an issue with the existing research on COVID-19 and weather (Jamshidi et al., 2020)
        -They said that existing research only considers weather variables during analysis
        -Instead, this study looked at weather variables alongside other things like population mobility (how much are people moving around) and urban density (how populated is this area)
        -They found that weather's impact was small, a few percent, where as things like population mobility and urban density had a much higher impact, 34% and 13%
    -One limitation to point out with both of these studies is the data that they had to work with
        -One study was submitted for review in September 2020 while the other study was submitted in November 2020 meaning that both of them were missing out on spikes seen in the US around the November - January timeframe
-setup problem/motivation
    -My proposed project is a visualization tool that would allow a user to look into this relationship between weather variables and COVID-19 transmission
    -What we have going on right now is an open scientific debate around weather's role in the pandemic
    -This presents a unique opportunity to engage students which is why the target user for my tool would be a middle school scientist
    -A tool like this could be used in a classroom activity where students are tasked with the same question of investigating weather's role in the pandemic
    -Students would be expected to follow the scientific process of creating their own hypothesis and then gathering evidence to support a conclusion
    -My tool would help them gather that evidence
    -Students would be expected to think critically about the limitations of what they might see in the tool and what conclusions can or cannot be drawn based on what they find
    -In 2018 there was a study done that looked at data use by middle and secondary school students (Lee, et. al., 2018)
        -One thing they looked at was how teachers can best support students working with data
        -One of their recommendations was that data should be leveraged in the classroom in the context of meaningful scientific pursuits
        -My tool falls right in line with this recommendation because students would be asked to participate in this open scientific debate

Demo
-Now I would like to do a demo of the tool I've spent this last summer building
    -search for or click county
    -chart settings (show updated charts for each)
        -date range
        -weather data point
        -aggregation
    -sharing work
        -open link in new tab

Methods
-Now I'm going to talk about how I ended up building this tool.
-From a high level, I pretty much implemented everything exactly as I had planned it in my initial proposal
-Data sources
    -COVID
        -For COVID-19 data I decided on the New York Times dataset on GitHub
        -Cumulative cases by county by day for all counties in US.
    -Weather
        -For my weather data I decided on using an API from WeatherSource
        -WeatherSource is a technology company that provides a suite of products that help businesses leverage weather and climate data
        -On March 16th, 2020 WeatherSource opened up their API for free to any researchers exploring the relationship between weather and the COVID-19 pandemic
        -One of their APIs allows you to query many different weather data points by location using latitude and longitude or a zip code along with a date range
        -Data can be returned in an hourly or daily format
        -For my purposes I am querying average temperature, average relative humidity and average absolute humidity by lat/long and a date range where the lat/long is the centroid of the county the user has selected
        -Data returned in a daily format
-Data transformation
    -COVID
        -I start with cumulative case counts by day for a county
        -I need to end up with new infections by day for a county
        -For any given day, subtract the cumulative case count for the previous day from the current day and you get new infections on that current day
        -This can then be rolled up to a weekly or 7-day rolling average
    -Weather
        -I start with the daily data points I need already
        -I can convert them to weekly or 7-day rolling averages in the same way as the COVID-19 data
-Resources
    -GitHub - I am leveraging GitHub for a few different things
        -I am using it for source control.
        -I am using GitHub actions for CI/CD
        -I am using a GitHub Project board for tracking user stories and bugs
    -Azure - My tool is hosted in Azure using a few different Azure resources
        -Azure App Service
            -I am using an Azure App Service for serving up the Angular Application as well as providing several API endpoints for the weather and COVID-19 data.
        -Azure SQL database
            -I am using an Azure SQL Database for housing the COVID-19 data that I pull from the New York Times dataset.
        -Azure Function
            -I am using an Azure Function App for loading the COVID-19 data from the dataset from the New York Times hosted on GitHub. This data is in a CSV format on GitHub.

Future work
-Now I am going to talk about some of the limitations in the current implementation and opportunities for future work.
-usability testing
    -The next thing that probably needs to be done for this project is to do some usability testing by getting it in front of real students.
    -This could be done with a classroom study with a middle school science class where they are given an activity that involves using the tool.
    -An eye tracking study to see how people are reasoning about the data might be useful as well.
-One limitation of the current implementation is that weather data is continuous but I represent it as discrete
    -I am using the centroid of each county in order to sample the weather data
    -This is a rough approximation and gets less accurate the bigger the county is
    -A more accurate representation of this data would be a good opportunity for future work
-Another opportunity for future work is to better capture the spatial component of the data
    -Both weather and COVID data have a spatial component
    -Currently the application only shows you data from one county at a time
    -This makes it difficult to understand how the data might differ by location
    -Allowing users to see data from multiple counties would be a good next step

Challenges
-Now I'd like to talk a little bit about some challenges I ran into while implementing the tool
-for the most part, there were not any major hurdles that popped up. Just normal software development stuff, dealing with random errors and things like that. Things taking a lot longer to implement than I thought.
-That leads me into my next challenge which was finding the time to work on it with my full time job. Often times I would write code all day at work and then come home and write code for a few more hours. This made for some long days and I am very happy to be finished, although this was enjoyable to work on for the most part.
-Azure learning curve
    -Since I had limited experience building things with Azure there was a little bit of a learning curve there while I was getting my services set up. Azure has pretty good documentation and for a lot of stuff I was able to follow their simple tutorials online.
-calling things 'good enough'
    -The toughest challenge for me personally throughout the project was knowing when to call things 'good enough'
    -I did not have the time or resources to make everything perfect so I had to make concious decisions to call my current implementation good enough so I could move onto the other things I needed to implement.




Questions
-Before I open it up to everyone for questions I would actually like to discuss 2 questions I received from one of the professors on my committee.
-I emailed them my project proposal document last week and Dr. Brian Ricks replied with 2 questions he would like us to address in our meeting on Thursday
-His first question was 'If researchers have found that the relationship between weather and COVID spread is low, what do you think the middle school students will conclude?'
    -As some background, I've been working with Dr. Dorn on my graduate committee throughout the semester on this proposal so he knows everything about my project already
    -Dr. Dorn was the one who came up with this idea of making this tool for students because at that time all I knew I wanted to do was make a data visualization with COVID-19 and the weather
    -Targeting students allowed us to really scope the project to a well defined purpose, with that purpose being to enable a classroom activity where students are engaged in an open scientific debate
    -We want the students to think critically about what they are seeing in this tool and more specifically what they are not seeing
    -It is very plausible that students could go to a county and see what they think is a stong correlation between weather and COVID-19 infection rates
    -We want them to be challenged to think about what else could be causing this? What am I not seeing?
        -For instance, what local policies were enacted in this county and when? What's the mobility index for this county across this date range?
    -So in a way we're pushing a lot of responsibility outside of the tool because it allowed us to scope my project to a limited set of concerns (weather and COVID-19)
-His second question was 'Do you have any thoughts about how to determine if the project accomplished the goal of student learning?'
    -I actually don't have an answer for this one right now
    -In my proposal document I sent them I had a timeline of the development tasks needed to build this but nothing really about validating it so I think that's something I still have to think through with my committee
-Now I would like to open it up to the floor for any questions
