Foreword
-NIST is govt agency?
-surprising how interested the govt is in creating secure systems for private businesses
-kinda scary how much of a national security concern this is
-US is not well postured at all to handle a full on attack (cyber, military, etc.)
-calls for protecting our assets, integrating security into processes
-systems security engineering is a specialty discipline of systems engineering

-systems engineering is meant to produce a capability (the system)
-system security requires security activities to be integrated into the processes of the system engineering effort
-knowing your assets and engineering to protect against their loss are the focal points of systems security engineering

2.1
-SSE = systems security engineering
-SSE must provide evidence of security
-SSE takes investment, will not happen passively
-SSE needs to be able to do cost/benefit analysis on security functions and considerations
-SSE provide security perspective to SE processes/activities

2.2
-system = set of interacting elements organized to achieve a purpose
-every system's environment can have an effect on it
-system element can be a system on its own so context matters when talking about a system
-system of interest = focus of engineering effort

2.3
-SSE delivers 'adequately' secure systems
-stakeholders define the value of an asset in the context of its loss
-protection not only implies prevention but: detection, recovery, prediction of asset loss
-secure system is one where the system is free from those conditions that can result in unacceptable asset loss
-security tends to focus on loss in terms of the adversary that 'caused' it but conditions and other events can enable it as well
-must recognize that we do not know everything
-security needs to account for when the system is in a degraded state

2.3.1
-active protection = explicit security functionality whose behavior satisfies security requirements
-passive protection = environment of execution (architecture, design)
-adequate security comes from the reasoned sum of all security protections (active and passive)

2.3.2
-security failure = not meeting security requirements, objectives or performance measures or exhibiting unspecified behavior, interactions or producing unspecified results
-security failures can be forced (malicious hacker or normal user) and unforced (machine level errors)
-security failure is defined and assessed in terms of asset loss
-events associated with security failure = threats

2.3.3
-strategy for system security should be proactive (address what CAN happen, not what MIGHT happen) and reactive (despite the best plan, shit happens, need to be able to react appropriately when it does)
-how much investment you make in security depends on the value of the asset

2.3.4
-System Security = 'Freedom from those conditions that can cause a loss of assets with unacceptable consequences'
-System Security can be very subjective at times based on how the different stakeholders evaluate asset loss and its consequences
    -security is achieved through reasoning
-can never say system is secure, can say it is insecure

2.3.5
-characteristics of a system that contribute to its security characteristic
    -makeup of system, mechanical, human elements
        -technology used
    -modes of system
    -criticality of system
    -consequence of failure
    -the way the capability of the system is delivered
        -service, function, operation
        -delivered as system of systems

2.3.6
-roles for SSE
    -engineering the security functions that provide security capabilities
    -engineering security driven constraints of system functions
    -engineering and advising for the protection of data/assets associated with the system

2.4 Systems Security Engineering Framework
-Framework
    -problem context
        -define security requirements
    -solution context
        -solve for security requirements
    -trustworthiness context
        -demonstrate that system is adequately secure
-system security analyses
    -produces data to inform engineering and stakeholder decision making
-framework is a feedback loop as well to iterate through
