Stuff I got done
-browsed some research papers
-looking into open weather api
    -I might have to make this work with a subset of locations that I preselect
    -emailed them asking what I could get access to for free as a student, I think I need bulk history data
-looking into covid data sources
    -Covid tracking project (The Atlantic)
    -NYTimes

Questions I have
-Do I have a budget?
    -Would I be able to use any cloud providers?
    -GRACA, $5,000, 3-4 page proposal, paid out in summer, first come first serve, might need to be student in fall
    -dont really have budget for project
    -could get software licenses I might need
    -hosting on unomaha.community
        -can also get DB
    -AWS student credit

What I will do next
-look into free could hosting for students
-get back to finding research papers that solve similar problems
-additional data sources:
    -https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data
    -http://www.healthdata.org/covid/data-downloads

Meeting notes
-next couple weeks should scope what I want to do
-papers
    -explore different techniques people have used and what are they good for
    -I have spatial data, temporal data
        -could find other papers that work with this
            -epidem.. papers that deal with similar temporal data
    -help find tools that might be useful
    -weather/epidemic visualizations
        -flu?
-proposal
    'xyz approach has proven to be useful here...'
-what is geographical scope of visualization?
-add policies in locations to visualization
    -'
-might want to look at NOAA against
    -accuweather
    -weather underground: https://www.wunderground.com/
-if we really cant get all the locations we want we could pilot with subset of locations
-most granular covid data is at county level
    -some counties are large enough that weather might vary significantly
-can refer to things like
    -atlantic data visualization guide
-talk about how what I am doing is different
    -why is it necessary and novel
-document different data sources to compare/contrast
