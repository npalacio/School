Historical weather api: https://openweathermap.org/history
-normally not free but has student access option for free
    -bulk history you pay per location ($10/location)
-has min/max weather by location
    -this might make it difficult for viewing on a map?
-history api
    -hourly historical data for cities
    -query by city
    -has min/max temps that are not min/max for the day but temps recorded at the same time in different parts of city
        -represents the range of temps in the city at moment of calculation
-history bulk api
    -can go back 40 years (I think I just need 1-2 years)
    -provides hourly data
        -could probably aggregate this on client side
    -you pick individual locations and checkout
-I am looking for daily min/max temps by location (city, zip, etx.)

NOAA: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets
-has API that provides daily weather data from a 'station'
-had to request token that was emailed to me with rate limits on requests
    -5 requests/second
    -10,000 requests/day
-API seems to have a bit of a learning curve
-Daily summaries dataset seems to have what I want (temp/precip)
-many ways to specify location you want to work with
    -weather station name
    -zip
-this looks like what I need, previously I had visited their v1 api page that was very outdated
-a lot of documentation
-can't seem to get to their site or hit their API on sunday morning

Weather Underground: https://www.wunderground.com/
-found a post saying their free weather api is no longer available
-cant find any API on their site
-seemed to have removed a download feature that was in UI before
