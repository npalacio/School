-touchpoints
    -security activities done at different points in the SDLC
    -most important touchpoints are code reviews and architectural risk analysis
    -third place is pen testing
        -most places today put this in first place but it is very reactive (finding the problem after its been deployed to Prod)
        -first 2 focus on the process
        -can force an organization to start investing in security
    -external analysis by someone not designing the system is important
-way better to find security issues early in SDLC
