Abstract

Introduction
-The COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost the entire world
-It started spreading as early as November 2019 (cite something)
-The US reported its first case XX/XX/XXXX (cite something)
-Since then the US has experienced several waves of increased infection rates that has varied in severity across the country (cite something)
-The way the virus spreads is known (droplets, close contact, etc.) (cite something)
-The virus is known to spread more easily indoors
-People spend more time indoors when the weather is colder
    -Am I going to find a citation for something like this?
-One could hypothesize that when the weather gets colder and people spend more time indoors the virus would spread more
-There are many different factors that can affect COVID-19 infection rates
-We know that weather affects seasonal influenza rates (cite papers)
-My project aims to explore the relationship between weather and COVID-19 infection rates throughout the US
-My intended Audience
    -public?
        -I am not sure the public would necessarily care to hear about how weather affects COVID-19 infection rates
        -Could make them more aware that when the weather changes and they are spending more time inside they should be more cautious
    -public officials
        -It would be useful to policy makers if they knew that a change in weather was coming that they knew would (or would not) drive infection rates
            -Could influence their policy decisions
-from another paper: 'Better epidemic predictions would set up more appropriate public health prevention and intervention strategies.'
    -see Zotero notes on 'Quantifying role of weather...'

Methods
-it is a web app
    -accessible to everyone
-it is map based (location centric)
    -the effect of weather could vary based on the area of interest
-data sources
    -COVID: NY Times
        -hosted on GitHub
        -CSV format
        -has cumulative COVID infections by county for US
    -Weather: Weather source
        -paid API
            -free access to researchers looking into weather and COVID
        -can view daily, hourly weather history by ZIP code or lat/long
-data preparation
    -can calculate new daily infections by county
    -weather data can be queried by lat/long using centroid of US counties
    -Inputs: US county, begin date, end date
    -Output:
        -chart with time on x-axis
        -weather data on y1 (with 1 week lag)
            -average weekly temperature
                -average weekly absolute humidity? average weekly relative humidity? Would need another axis for these. Should I plot these in separate charts?
        -covid data on y2
            -average weekly infection rate (new infections per week)
        -just start with first day of range, for every 7 days:
            -sum up daily new infections = new infections that week
                -or should I calculate average infections/day for that week?
            -calculate average temperature for that week
    -data definitions
        -average weekly temperature (avgWeeklyTemp) = (tempDay1 + tempDay2 + ... + tempDay7)/7
        -average absolute humidity temperature = (absHumDay1 + absHumDay2 + ... + absHumDay7)/7
        -average relative humidity temperature = (relHumDay1 + relHumDay2 + ... + relHumDay7)/7
        -weekly relative variation of temp = avgWeeklyTempWeek2 - avgWeeklyTempWeek1
        -weekly absolute variation of temp = |avgWeeklyTempWeek2 - avgWeeklyTempWeek1|
        -average weekly new daily infections = (newInfectionsDay1 + newInfectionsDay2 + ... + newInfectionsDay7)/7
-data visualization
    -core pieces:
        -a map where a user can pick a county of interest
        -somewhere to input a date range from user
        -charts for:
            -weekly COVID infections
            -weekly average temp
            -weekly average abs humidity
            -weekly relative variation of temp
    -Questions:
        -Probably pick 2 weather charts to start with?
            -Temp, absolute humidity
        -Should the map be symbolized using any of this data?
            -Would be cool if counties with a strong correlation of COVID to weather were symbolized differently but not sure how I would do that
            -seems like a nice to have?
        -How to best visualize COVID and weather datasets?
            -Current best idea is separate charts because these data points all have different scales
            -Charts could share user interactions
                -user hovers on 1 and tooltip shows on all of them?
