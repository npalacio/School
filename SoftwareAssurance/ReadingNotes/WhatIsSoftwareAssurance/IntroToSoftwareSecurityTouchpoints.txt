-touchpoints
    -security activities done at different points in the SDLC
    -most important touchpoints are code reviews and architectural risk analysis
    -third place is pen testing
        -most places today put this in first place but it is very reactive (finding the problem after its been deployed to Prod)
        -first 2 focus on the process
        -can force an organization to start investing in security
    -external analysis by someone not designing the system is important
-way better to find security issues early in SDLC
-most commercial security products and services focus on solving the problem late in the SDLC (in operations)
-'The clueless are often gifted with the ability to be clueless in multiple dimensions simultaneously'
-implementing any of these touchpoints helps even if you cant do them all
-operations vs development in security
-person who knows the system the best is best candidate to make it secure
-developers are the best candidates to turn into software security folk
-because there are so many different types of people in security today, because standard academic degrees are not common enough, we get a great variety of viewpoints
    -should be careful to not turn into a discipline with only one type of person
