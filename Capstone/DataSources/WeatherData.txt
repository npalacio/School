-normally not free but has student access option for free
    -bulk history you pay per location ($10/location)
-has min/max weather by location
    -this might make it difficult for viewing on a map?
-history api
    -hourly historical data for cities
    -query by city
    -has min/max temps that are not min/max for the day but temps recorded at the same time in different parts of city
        -represents the range of temps in the city at moment of calculation
-history bulk api
    -can go back 40 years (I think I just need 1-2 years)
    -provides hourly data
        -could probably aggregate this on client side
    -you pick individual locations and checkout
-I am looking for daily min/max temps by location (city, zip, etx.)

NOAA
-had site to pick locations and export the data but I think I will need an API I can program against unless I just pick one location
-site looks outdated
-not a lot of documentation
