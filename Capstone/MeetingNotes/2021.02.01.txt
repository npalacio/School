Stuff I got done
-Covid data source comparison
-Got setup with a few NOAA api calls, explored API
    -This API looks like what I want (historical daily weather data points: temp, precip, tons of others)

Questions I have
-If I want a data point that shows how fast the rate that the virus is spreading is changing in an area should I use
    -change in # of positive tests daily?
    -cases/X people?

Meeting notes

What I will do next
