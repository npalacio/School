-Requirements are elicited, they are drawn out from customer using structured method
-2 technical processes in requirements phase of SDLC can integrate security
    -Stakeholder needs and requirements definition process
        -should define stakeholder security requirements
        -this would include protection capabilities, security characteristics and security driven constraints
        -should identify general features and security features
    -System requirements definition process
        -transforming stakeholder requirements to technical system requirements
        -output of this process is list of active protection capabilities
        -should also figure out how strong of assurance is needed for system
-What is the environment vs the machine?
    -stakeholder requirements are typically about the environment
    -system requirements are about the machine
-software needs to fit a purpose, bad software can happen when purpose does not match what was built
-Use cases
    -why and how would someone use the software
    -goal driven scenarios
        -software should accomplish something
-user stories
    -'as a X I want Y so that GOAL'
    -goal driven scenarios
    -Card, Conversation, Confirmation

2 - What is Requirements Engineering (RE)
-RE is bridge between real world user needs and software systems
-RE identifies purpose and context of software
-RE builds bride between stakeholder requirements and system requirements
-Is the env of operation the technical environment or the business environment?
-Shared phenomena = interface = input or output of human and machine
-what is a domain?
    -given domain = things that exist
        -indicative mood
    -design domain = what we want to produce as an artifact
-requirements are all about relationships between things in the environment of operation
