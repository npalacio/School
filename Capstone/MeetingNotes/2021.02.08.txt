Stuff I got done
-learning more about NOAA API
    -trying to get call that returns daily min/max/avg temp for a given location and date range
        -not as simple as I thought lol
-took a look at some existing COVID data visualizations
-started looking at research for weather data visualizations

Questions I have
-Data quality might be an issue with NOAA api, thinking about if I should simplify down to a few locations for initial proposal
-When roughly should I be submitting a proposal?
    -before end of summer, defend proposal during finals week
        -committee needs draft 2 weeks before defense
            -early april
    -defend week before dead week
    -only hard rule: has to be done before enrolling for summer


Meeting notes
-running averages for weather and covid data
    -3-7 day running average
-the day that someone tested positive is not the day they were infected
-Could I only use weather stations at airports?
    -Filter by converage
-If someone were using this tool and we can't find data where they look then we could just display a message
-What visualizations exist for the seasonal flu?
    -does the same visualization show different trends for Covid than for flu?
-pick a location and build visualization in excel quick
    -7 day averages


What I will do next
-Want to end up with spreadsheet: Location (Omaha, Douglas, etc.), Date, Min temp, max temp
    -See if weather stations at airports are consistently good (data wise)
-Continue to find weather visualizations
-start thinking about text
    -think about motivation, why do we need another covid visualization?
    -how do you differentiate between things that happen (holidays) and colder weather
    -exploratory tool for everyday people to poke around in?
-POC: visualization in excel
