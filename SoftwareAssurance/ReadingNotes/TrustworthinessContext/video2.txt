first pass
-top level claim
    -sub claim = your argument
        -evidence
-claim = predicate
    -{noun-phrase} + {verb} + {value}
    -{the system} + {has} + {no XSS vulnerabilities} 

-most assurance cases are to try and convince people without any background knowledge of the system (an auditor, etc.)
-assurance cases are for things that are too complex to fully understand
    -avoid using for trivial things
-claim should have a subject and say something about a property of that subject
-claim should be about an outcome we want for a system (an emergent property?)
-'the system minimized information disclosure during communication'
-property that you make your claim about should be non-trivial (emergent?)
-the value of the property that you want to claim should communicate any related uncertainty
    -I can only minimize this thing
        -would be for qualitative properties
        -The system is acceptably secure
    -I can make this value be X
        -would be for quantitative properties
        -The system has no exploitable SQL injection vulnerabilities
-verb phrase of claim should be the predicate that describes a critical property of noun phrase, along with that properties value and any related uncertainty
-context
    -defines scope of claim
    -provides a means to check satisfaction of claim
    -can be external references or definitions
    -ex: publication from NIST for security considerations for supply chain processes
-justification
    -provides rationale for why a claim was made
    -'this claim is needed because there are reports of threats in this space'
-sub claims and top level claim should talk about the same entity
