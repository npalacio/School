Stuff I got done
-Covid data source comparison
-Got setup with a few NOAA api calls, explored API and got postman collection in source control
    -This API looks like what I want (historical daily weather data points: temp, precip, tons of others)
-Azure has free student offering: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/
    -looks like it has everything I might need
-Found some GIS Visualization papers with useful tips/info, tooks notes in Zotero

Questions I have
-If I want a data point that shows how fast the rate that the virus is spreading is changing in an area should I use
    -change in # of positive tests daily?
    -cases/X people?
