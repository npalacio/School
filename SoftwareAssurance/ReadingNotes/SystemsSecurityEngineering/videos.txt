1
-need to establish case for investment in security since it does have a cost
-6 tiers of attackers
    -1-2: using known vulnerabilities
    -3-4: finding new vulnerabilities
    -5-6: create vulnerabilities (US, Chine, Russia)
-one country that creates mass consumer electronics can be seen as a big threat
-3 tiers of vulnerabilities
    -1: known
    -2: unknown
    -3: adversary created
    -2&3 are invisible
    -iceberg, 'above and below the waterline' vulnerabilities

2
-enabling system = supports system of interest but does not directly contribute to its functionality
    -compilers, IDE, unit tests
-active protections = have to add code for these
    -access control, SSO, authentication
-passive protections = having up to date compilers, SDKs
    -architecture, design, code review
-adequate security
    -well reasoned sum of active and passive protections
    -for all system execution modes (initialization, operation, shutdown)
    -for all system states (degraded, etc)
    -for all transitions between state and modes

3
-problem context = sufficiently complete understanding of the problem
    -define security objectives and measures of success
    -security requirements - specify functionaly, assurance and strength characteristics of a protection mechanism
        -access control = functional
        -secure coding standards being followed in development = assurance requirement
        -rigor in enforcement and granularity of access control = strength requirement
-solution context
    -collect evidence that the solution meets requirements
-trustworthiness context = evidence based demonstration that the system of interest is trustworthy
    -developing well reasoned argument for security of system
