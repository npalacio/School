Stuff I got done
-Reworked introduction/related work sections based on feedback
-Added in researchÂ to support why a COVID data visualization for middle school scientists is a good idea
-Researched related work for data visualizations for kids using the articles you sent me as a starting point

Questions I have
-A lot of the existing work for data visualization and kids seems to be around physics/chemistry? Not sure how much of that would apply for what I want to do?
    -Maybe this is why my visualization is needed?
    -I am trying to say 'These other visualizations for kids did this, so I will too...'

Meeting notes
-can contrast existing vis for kids with mine
    -these are static but interactive
    -kids can explore cause/effect in these
        -lets kids play with input, run sim, view output based on new input
        -kind of similar?
    -reasoning about error, linear relationships, might come more from math?
-data science curriculum
    -project bootstrap: bootstrapworld.org 
    -want kids to engage in reasoning about debate, how are these vars related
    -want them to be able to observe, reason about regression models, noise and error, inform an argument around strength of relationship
    -other curr have similar goals to what I am aiming for
    -student will have same questions in bootstrap as in my activity
    -how can we get kids to consider other explanations to a relationship they might see? threats to validity
        -what are other variables we do not see? masks, local policies
    -'these activities are done elsewhere (bootstrap) and are valuable'
-features
    -could write up user story list
        -documents the why as well
        -

What I will do next
-scheduling poll for last week of April (26-30), would aim to send proposal 1 week before, looking for 1 hour block
    -talk through proposal with 20 min presentation
