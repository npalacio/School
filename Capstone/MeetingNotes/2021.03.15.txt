Stuff I got done

Questions I have
-how to cite NE school standards?
-would I need to explain temperature and humidity given the audience?
-do I need to write up what the activity would be?
-I dont really know when to get into the details of my visualization, specifically:
    -what are the features? How specific do I get and when?
        -Should I show a mockup or visual in intro of what the project is?
    -intended audience
-how to cite Weather Source API
-Struggling with this question: If the purpose of my visualization is to allow a 7th grade scientist to explore this data on their own what specific features should I include?
    -let users pick weather data points to look at
        -temp, abs humidity, rel humidity, whatever else weather source has
    -toggle normalization of data
    -toggle smoothing out data or not?
