I think I would want % of covid tests positive by county, city?

Covid tracking project: https://covidtracking.com/data
-visualization guide: https://covidtracking.com/about-data/visualization-guide
-can only provide data at state level
    -I would prefer city/county level

NY Times: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
-data is in CSV files on Github that you can download for free
-has county level data
-has total confirmed cases and probable cases
    -some places only report confirmed cases
-they count cases where patient is treated, not necessarily where they live
-are cases for a county cumulative in their data or just cases reported on that date?
    -in state dataset it looks cumulative
    -documentation says it is cumulative
        -when a state/county does not show up on a date that means there were 0 new cases/deaths on that day
    -I think I need to know how many new people were infected daily at the county level, could probably calculate this from their data
