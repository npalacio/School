Stuff I got done
-read flu and weather paper
    -got some ideas for how my data should be prepped
    -one difference with the flu is they have years of data to compare against, we have 1
    -these papers I am finding are doing intensive statistical analysis to demonstrate a relationship between weather and flu, I want to build a visualization
        -I think I can use these papers to get an idea of how to prepare my data
-thinking I might want to roll up cases and temp data to weekly averages
    -also might want to introduce lag where weather from previous week is compared to infections from this week
-looked at flu visualizations
    -cdc
-WeatherSource for weather data
