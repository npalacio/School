Foreword
-NIST is govt agency?
-surprising how interested the govt is in creating secure systems for private businesses
-kinda scary how much of a national security concern this is
-US is not well postured at all to handle a full on attack (cyber, military, etc.)
-calls for protecting our assets, integrating security into processes
-systems security engineering is a specialty discipline of systems engineering

-systems engineering is meant to produce a capability (the system)
-system security requires security activities to be integrated into the processes of the system engineering effort
-knowing your assets and engineering to protect against their loss are the focal points of systems security engineering

2.1
-SSE = systems security engineering
-SSE must provide evidence of security
-SSE takes investment, will not happen passively
-SSE needs to be able to do cost/benefit analysis on security functions and considerations
-SSE provide security perspective to SE processes/activities

2.2
-system = set of interacting elements organized to achieve a purpose
-every system's environment can have an effect on it
-system element can be a system on its own so context matters when talking about a system
-system of interest = focus of engineering effort

2.3
-SSE delivers 'adequately' secure systems
-stakeholders define the value of an asset in the context of its loss
-protection not only implies prevention but: detection, recovery, prediction of asset loss
-secure system is one where the system is free from those conditions that can result in unacceptable asset loss
-security tends to focus on loss in terms of the adversary that 'caused' it but conditions and other events can enable it as well
-must recognize that we do not know everything
-security needs to account for when the system is in a degraded state
