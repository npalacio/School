Stuff I got done
-POC in excel
    -little bit of learning curve
    -realizing that my current line chart with both datasets might not work because both have different ranges of values so plotting them together like I have seems wrong
    -just did temp for now, could also explore humidity?
-worked on proposal outline

Questions I have
-how to visualize these datasets in POC?
-what if we find that weather does not appear to have an effect?
    -Is visualization still worth building?

Meeting notes


What I will do next
