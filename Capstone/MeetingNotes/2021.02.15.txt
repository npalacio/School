Stuff I got done
-POC in excel
    -little bit of learning curve
    -realizing that my current line chart with both datasets might not work because both have different ranges of values so plotting them together like I have seems wrong
    -just did temp for now, could also explore humidity?
    -I wonder if the drop in temperature only matters when it crosses threshold of nice to be outside (~60-70 deg F)
-worked on proposal outline

Questions I have
-how to visualize these datasets in POC?
-what if we find that weather does not appear to have an effect?
    -Is visualization still worth building?

Meeting notes
-what is the correlation between normal flu and temperature?
-https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4881007/
    -flu and weather
-mobility data
-tool should let people explore these different variables
-http://www.gamesforchange.org/game/darfur-is-dying/
-what about population density?
    -nomalize new covid case count, would see higher rate in densely populated areas
-could compare against flu
-how would we get policy data

What I will do next
-look at flu/weather paper and look at others
