Introduction
-who am I
    -Nick Palacio
    -Application Developer at FCSA for 2.5 years
    -Been working on my Masters in Computer Science from UNO since 2017, set to graduate this August
-FCSA: what is this presentation
    -This is my project proposal for my Masters Capstone project
    -Will be presenting this to my graduate committe this Thursday
    -This committee consists of 3 professors from UNO:
        -Dr. Brian Dorn, Associate Professor of Computer Science
        -Dr. Rex Cammack, Associate Professor of Geography
        -Dr. Brian Ricks, Associate Professor of Computer Science
    -They will decide if my project can move forward where I would implement it over the summer or if changes need to be made before that can happen
-This presentation will be:
    -me creating some context around what my project is and why it is important
    -then I'm going to talk about some related work already out there that is similar to what I want to do
    -finally I will go in depth on what my project actually is and how I will build it as well as why

Background
-create context
    -Some of you might remember when this pandemic began last spring some people said this would all just 'go away' with warmer weather...
    -While we know that this did not all just 'go away', people were bringing this up because weather's effect on the season flu is actually well established.
    -There was a study done in France in 2016 that looked at weather's role on seasonal influenza spread (Roussel et al., 2016)
        -This study found that a couple groups of weather variables had an impact of influenza spread
            -The first group was temperature, aboslute humidity and daily variation of aboslute humidity
            -The second group was sunshine duration, relative humidity and daily variation of relative humidity
            -The impact of these groups of weather variables was found to be between 3% - 6%, so relatively low but still there
            -This study mentioned that their results were consistent with similar studies in other parts of the world where a weather impact on influenza spread was found to be a few percent as well
    -There have been a few studies this last year looking at weather's role in the COVID-19 pandemic
        -Results have been mixed
        -One literature review summarized the work of 23 studies that investigated the relationship between COVID-19 transmission and different weather variables (McClymont & Hu, 2021)
            -This literature review found that most studies who looked at temperature or humidity found a correlation with COVID-19 transmission\
            -However, some reported a positive correlation while others reported a negative correlation
    -Another study published in the same journal highlighted an issue with the existing research on COVID-19 and weather (Jamshidi et al., 2020)
        -They said that existing research only considers weather variables during analysis
        -Instead, this study looked at weather variables alongside other things like population mobility (how much are people moving around) and urban density (how populated is this area)
        -They found that weather's impact was small, a few percent, where as things like population mobility and urban density had a much higher impact, 34% and 13%
    -One limitation to point out with both of these studies is the data that they had to work with
        -One study was submitted for review in September 2020 while the other study was submitted in November 2020 meaning that both of them were missing out on spikes seen in the US around the November - January timeframe
-setup problem/motivation
    -My proposed project is a visualization tool that would allow a user to look into this relationship between weather variables and COVID-19 transmission
    -What we have going on right now is an open scientific debate around weather's role in the pandemic
    -This presents a unique opportunity to engage students which is why the target user for my tool would be a middle school scientist
    -A tool like this could be used in a classroom activity where students are tasked with the same question of investigating weather's role in the pandemic
    -Students would be expected to follow the scientific process of creating their own hypothesis and then gathering evidence to support a conclusion
    -My tool would help them gather that evidence
    -Students would be expected to think critically about the limitations of what they might see in the tool and what conclusions can or cannot be drawn based on what they find
    -In 2018 there was a study done that looked at data use by middle and secondary school students (Lee, et. al., 2018)
        -One thing they looked at was how teachers can best support students working with data
        -One of their recommendations was that data should be leveraged in the classroom in the context of meaningful scientific pursuits
        -My tool falls right in line with this recommendation because students would be asked to participate in this open scientific debate

Related work
-other covid visualizations

    -In order to start figuring out what my visualization might look like I looked at 3 existing COVID-19 data visualizations
        -John Hopkins
        -The COVID Tracking Project by The Atlantic
        -The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington

    -I evaluated them along 4 dimensions in order to compare and contrast them with what I might want to do:
        -How granular is the data?
        -Which COVID-19 data points are used?
        -Do they provide any spatial view?
        -How configurable are they?

    -Summary
        -Only 1 had COVID-19 data granularity at the county level, the rest were at the state or country level
            -Given that weather can vary greatly across any state the location granularity becomes much more important which is why I will use county level COVID-19 data
        -All of them used similar COVID-19 data points
            -For my purposes I will be using confirmed cases
        -All of them provided a spatial or map based view of the data
            -Since weather and COVID-19 data has a spatial component a spatial view for my visualization would be warranted
        -Varying levels of configurability in these visualizations
            -I will offer a high level of configurability in my visualization in order to allow the user to visualize the data in a few different ways

Methods
-For the next part of my presentation I am going to talk about what exactly I propose building and how I think I can accomplish that
-I propose building a map based web application that will allow a user to visualize COVID-19 and weather data alongside each other in order to investigate the relationship between the two.
-Now I am going to walk through some mockups of what the user interface for this tool might look like
    -Mockups
        -There was a literature review performed in 2002 that looked at the cognitive literature on how people understand graphs. This paper looked at 3 factors that influence a viewer's understanding of a graph:
            -the visual characteristics of the graph
            -a viewer's knowledge about graphs
            -a viewer's knowledge about the data in the graph
        -This paper synthesized their findings into recommendations for how to best present graphs to students. One of their recommendations was to represent the same data in multiple formats because this helps students' understanding when there are multiple quantitative facts to communicate about the data. I have 3 quantitative facts that I wish to communicate about the data
            -what is the trend of COVID-19 infections
            -what is the trend of the weather data point, temperature for instance
            -what is the covariance of COVID-19 infections with the weather data point

-Now I'm going to talk about how I would go about building this, starting with my data sources.
    -Data sources
        -I evaluated several data sources for both COVID-19 and Weather data.
        -COVID
            -For COVID-19 data I decided on the New York Times dataset on GitHub
            -Cumulative cases by county by day for all counties in US.
        -Weather
            -For my weather data I decided on using an API from WeatherSource
            -WeatherSource is a technology company that provides a suite of products that help businesses leverage weather and climate data
            -On March 16th, 2020 WeatherSource opened up their API for free to any researchers exploring the relationship between weather and the COVID-19 pandemic
            -One of their APIs allows you to query many different weather data points by location using latitude and longitude or a zip code along with a date range
            -Data can be returned in an hourly or daily format
            -For my purposes I will be querying average temperature, average relative humidity and average absolute humidity by lat/long and a date range where the lat/long will be the centroid of the county the user has selected
            -Data returned in a daily format
    -Data transformation
        -COVID
            -I start with cumulative case counts by day for a county
            -I need to end up with new infections by day for a county
            -For any given day, subtract the cumulative case count for the previous day from the current day and you get new infections on that current day
            -This can then be rolled up to a weekly or 7-day rolling average
        -Weather
            -I start with the daily data points I need already
            -I can convert them to weekly or 7-day rolling averages in the same way as the COVID-19 data
    -Resources
        -I want to build my project in the cloud...no pun intended
        -Azure offers a free student account
        -Here are the Azure resources I think I will use
            -Azure App Service
                -To host an ASP.NET Core Web Application that will serve up an Angular frontend and provide API endpoints for serving up the COVID-19 and weather data
            -Azure SQL database
                -Loaded nightly or weekly with COVID-19 data from the New York Times dataset on Github
                -Used by API serving up COVID-19 data
            -Azure Function or WebJob inside App Service
                -For this nightly load I am currently trying to decide between a WebJob or an Azure Function, any help would be much appreciated
                -1.2 million rows of data, ~12 MB
                -Leaning towards Function
        -Code repository hosted on GitHub with GitHub actions for CI/CD

Conclusion
-In summary, I propose building a visualization tool that would allow a user to investigate weather's role in the pandemic with the goal of engaging students in a real world scientific debate where they would be expected to follow the scientific process and think critically about what they might find.

Questions
-Before I open it up to everyone for questions I would actually like to discuss 2 questions I received from one of the professors on my committee.
-I emailed them my project proposal document last week and Dr. Brian Ricks replied with 2 questions he would like us to address in our meeting on Thursday
-His first question was 'If researchers have found that the relationship between weather and COVID spread is low, what do you think the middle school students will conclude?'
    -As some background, I've been working with Dr. Dorn on my graduate committee throughout the semester on this proposal so he knows everything about my project already
    -Dr. Dorn was the one who came up with this idea of making this tool for students because at that time all I knew I wanted to do was make a data visualization with COVID-19 and the weather
    -Targeting students allowed us to really scope the project to a well defined purpose, with that purpose being to enable a classroom activity where students are engaged in an open scientific debate
    -We want the students to think critically about what they are seeing in this tool and more specifically what they are not seeing
    -It is very plausible that students could go to a county and see what they think is a stong correlation between weather and COVID-19 infection rates
    -We want them to be challenged to think about what else could be causing this? What am I not seeing?
        -For instance, what local policies were enacted in this county and when? What's the mobility index for this county across this date range?
    -So in a way we're pushing a lot of responsibility outside of the tool because it allowed us to scope my project to a limited set of concerns (weather and COVID-19)
-His second question was 'Do you have any thoughts about how to determine if the project accomplished the goal of student learning?'
    -I actually don't have an answer for this one right now
    -In my proposal document I sent them I had a timeline of the development tasks needed to build this but nothing really about validating it so I think that's something I still have to think through with my committee
-Now I would like to open it up to the floor for any questions
