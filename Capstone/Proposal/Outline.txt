Introduction
-COVID timeline
-How it spreads
-Why weather
    -There is precedence to think that the COVID-19 virus spreads more easily in certain weather conditions.
        -It is well established that influenza spread is influenced by the weather.
        -Specifically, temperature, humidity and daily variation of both of these have been found to have a significant impact on influenza infection rates
        -While the coronavirus is certainly not the same thing as the flu it does spread in a very similar manner. This alone makes the relationship between COVID-19 transmission and the weather worth exploring.
    -There has been some research published already exploring the relationship between weather and COVID-19. However, results from these studies have been mixed.
        -One literature review published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public health analyzed the current available literature on the association between weather and COVID-19 incidence. This study concluded that weather does in fact play a significant role in COVID-19 transmission. Specifically, it said temperature and humidity were found to be the most common weather factors associated with COVID-19 transmission.
        -Another study published in the same journal highlighted an issue with the existing research on COVID-19 and weather. It said that existing research on this association only considers weather variables during analysis. This study concluded that weather on its own was a non-influential factor in COVID-19 transmission. Instead, it said that other factors such as urban density and mobility of the population influenced COVID-19 transmission much more than weather.
        -One limitation of both of these studies is the data that they both had to work with. The first research article discussed was received for peer review in November 2020. The second article was received in September 2020. This means that both articles were working with limited COVID-19 data, specifically missing out on spikes that were seen in the United States during the November - January time frame.
        -These articles highlight the need for continued exploration of the relationship between COVID-19 and the weather.
-Describe project
    -Existing research has been aimed at proving or disproving weather's effect on the pandemic. My project aims to allow a user to explore this relationship on their own as opposed to establishing whether one exists or not.
    -My proposed project is a web application that would allow a user to explore the relationship between weather and COVID-19 in different parts of the United States. This will be a map based web application that allows a user to go to an area of interest in the United States and view COVID-19 data and weather data together for a given date range.
        -A user would be able to view the weather and COVID data using charts that would be linked together
        -This visualization tool would have several configurable features that a user can set, such as:
            -location (county)
            -date range
            -lag between weather and COVID data
                -account for incubation and testing delays
            -weather data points
                -temperature
                -abs humidity
                -rel humidity
    -The intended user for my project would be a middle school scientist.
        -I have chosen this population(?) of users for several reasons. The effects of the pandemic have not been limited to any subset of the population. Students across the United States had to abruptly switch to remote learning as the pandemic began. My project aims to allow students to link what they are learning in school to what is happening in the world today.
            -My tool would help facilitate an activity in the classroom, virtual or otherwise, that would allow the students to investigate the hypothesis that weather does (or does not) influence COVID-19 transmission in the United States.
            -According to Nebraska standards for science education, by the 7th grade students should be able to understand evidence for how different factors contribute to the weather and climate. Students should also understand the scientific process for asking questions and carrying out investigations by gathering evidence. My project would help to reinforce these ideas by investigating the question of if weather affects COVID-19 transmission by following the scientific process.
            -Students would be expected to think critically about other factors besides weather that might drive infection rates as well.
                -How do I make them think about things like population density and mobility?
        -An activity like this could help drive STEM education by showing students what they are learning in school is related to what is going on in our world today.

    -This open debate in the scientific community presents a unique opportunity to engage students.
    -According to Nebraska standards for science education, by the 7th grade students should be able to understand evidence for how different factors contribute to the weather and climate. Students should also understand the scientific process for asking questions and carrying out investigations by gathering evidence (https://cdn.education.ne.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Nebraska_Science_Standards_Final_10_23.pdf)
    -Given the right tools, teachers could leverage this debate in order to engage students in the scientific process by tasking them to perform their own investigation into the same question of weather's role in the COVID-19 pandemic. My visualization would equip a teacher with a tool that students could use to explore this relationship. An activity like this would make the students think critically and ask questions about the data and what conclusions can, or cannot, be drawn.
    
    -A 2006 study by Linn et al. found evidence that visualization technologies can improve student learning outcomes while they learn scientific concepts. From a high level, this study compared assessment results for two groups of students who received different curriculum. One group received a normal curriculum while the other group received curriculum that included visualizations of scientific phenomena in order to help illustrate it. They found that both groups of students performed equally well on multiple choice assessment questions. However, the group that received the curriculum that included the visualizations performed significantly better on assessment questions that required the student to provide their own explanations. Questions that require the student to provide their own explanations are better able to discriminate varying levels of knowledge integration, making these findings significant. While my visualization does not try to explain any particular scientific phenomena like heat transfer or a chemical reaction it does provide students a visual representation of a couple scientific phenomena, disease spread and weather.
    
    -In 2018, Lee and Wilkerson studied data use by middle and secondary students and wrote their status report on this broad subject. One of the things they looked at was how teachers can best support students working with data. One of their recommendations for teachers' use of data in the classroom was that data should be leveraged in the context of meaningful scientific pursuits. My project falls in line with this guidance because students would be asked to participate in an open debate in the scientific community and draw their own conclusions using evidence they gather using the tool.

-See covid visualization examples
-In this section I will compare and contrast some existing COVID-19 data visualizations in order to highlight work that is currently out there as well as some gaps.
-I looked at COVID-19 data visualizations from John Hopkins University of Medicine, the COVID Tracking Project at the Atlantic and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington. I compared and contrasted the visualizations that these organizations offered along several dimensions. Specifically, I looked at the following: How granular is the COVID-19 data? Which COVID-19 data points are visualized? Does it offer a spatial view? Does it offer any linked views of data? How configurable are the visualizations? The results of this comparison can be see in Table 1.
-Now I will summarize my findings and discuss how this relates to my visualization. Only one of the organizations, John Hopkins, offered COVID-19 data at the county level in the US. Given that my visualization will show weather and COVID-19 data together, the location granularity of this data becomes more important. Weather in any state can vary greatly across different locations in that state. This is why my visualization will use county level COVID-19 data.
-All of the organizations offered the same COVID-19 data points in their visualizations (cases, deaths, etc.). For my purposes of allowing a user to compare COVID-19 infection rates to weather patterns I will only be using confirmed COVID-19 case counts.
-Since weather and COVID-19 infection rates both have a spatial dimension, a spatial view for my visualization is warranted. This is consistent with the existing visualizations I looked at, all 3 provided some sort of spatial view for the COVID-19 data. This is why I will be displaying a map to the user that they can interact with in order to view data at their location of interest.
-These organizations offered a variety of levels of configurability in their visualizations. Given that the purpose of my visualization is to allow a user to explore the data on their own I will offer a high level of configurability in my visualization in order to allow a user to visualize the data in a few different ways.

-Existing COVID-19 data visualizations all appear to share two traits that will be different for my visualization. The first is that existing visualizations seem to have the purpose of keeping the general public informed about the pandemic. This makes a lot of sense because keeping the public informed of what is going on helps them make informed decisions in their daily lives. The purpose of my visualization is to allow users, middle school scientists, to explore the relationship between two datasets, weather and COVID-19, and to think critically about this relationship.
-The second trait that existing visualizations share is that they are only concerned with visualizing COVID-19 data. My project will visualize COVID-19 data alongside weather data.

-These existing visualizations I looked at do not appear to be built with any specific group in mind. Their purpose seems to be to present this information to the public.

-something about how none of them look at weather and their target audience is the general public

    -REMOVING: Scatterplots are an effective tool for exploring the relationship between two variables (Interpreting Graphs: Students Developing...). 
        -I will provide a scatterplot of weather and COVID data.
    -Given my goal of allowing a user to investigate the relationship between two variables, COVID-19 infection and weather, a scatterplot graph is appropriate.
    -There has been research done investigating how students interpret graphs as well as best practices for providing graphs to students for their interpretation. A literature review by Hoeffner and Shah (2002) looked at the cognative literature on how people understand graphs as well as the factors that influence that understanding. This paper looked at 3 factors that influence a viewer's understanding of a graph: the visual characteristics of the graph, a viewer's knowledge about graphs, as well as a viewer's knowledge about the data in the graph. The paper synthesizes these findings into recommendations for how to best present graphs to students. (Review of Graph Comprehension Research...)
        -One of their recommendations was to represent the same data in multiple formats. This helps students' understanding when there are multiple quantitative facts to communicate about the data.
            -I have 3 quantitative facts about the data I wish to communicate for a given US county and date range: the trend of COVID-19 infections, the trend of several weather data points, and the covariance of COVID-19 infections with each weather data point.
            -Given this, I will provide a scatterplot graph that communicates the covariance of COVID-19 infections and a weather data point that a user could select from a predefined list. I will also provide individual line graphs of COVID-19 infections and each weather data point that will communicate the trend of each variable on its own.
        -Another recommendation from this paper was to be careful about the density of the data points, specifically for scatterplots because users often mentally exaggerate how correlated 2 variables are in a scatterplot that is very dense with data points. A graph can become more dense by either adding data points or shrinking its size. This means that I will need to be careful to not try to plot too many data points on the scatterplot I provide depending on its size.
