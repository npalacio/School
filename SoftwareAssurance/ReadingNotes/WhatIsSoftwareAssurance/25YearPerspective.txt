-1974, Multics OS had security issues
    -report for this was first to demonstrate issue in the code (bugs) and the issue of not baking security into the SDLC
-rise of internet in 1990 really exposed the issues in softare at that time
-mid 1990s people started to provide vocabulary for how people attack their software
    -attack trees, attack patterns, threat modeling
-2005, first sale of a vulnerability
    -for NSA employee sold linux vulnerability to US Govt for $80K
-people started attacking the IOT (medical devices, GPS, consumer electronics, printers)
-2012, govt created agency to vet electronics used by DOD for vulnerabilites/exploitation
-1985, Parnas resigns from agency (Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, SDIO) where they were making software to manage nuclear bombs
    -said software could not be 100% solid and risk of nuclear holocaust was too high
    -1990 two researchers from here publish Trusted Software Development Methodology, first secure SDLC methodology
-it is hard to find examples of exploited software because the govt and companies want to keep it secret/quiet
-CIA once deployed malware to canadian pipeline controller expecting it to be deployed in Russia
-before 1980s, security testing of software was testing the happy path of the security features (auth, access control)
-1990s, U of Wisc. would do stess testing on softare (DDoS)
-current software security testing fails to cover the whole picture, it lacks a situational awareness
-starting in 1980s software vendors and the DoD was concerned with softare piracy
    -DoD did not want the software they used to fall into hands of attackers who could start building an attack
    -vendors didnt want to lose money
    -vendors initially sent their softare with a dongle you had to plug into your computer for it to run
        -didnt work because enterprises needed backups and it was easy to lose dongles
    -vendors moved to licensing using more software like we do today
