Stuff I got done
-read flu and weather papers
    -got some ideas for how my data should be prepped
    -one difference with the flu is they have years of data to compare against, we have 1
    -these papers I am finding are doing intensive statistical analysis to demonstrate a relationship between weather and flu, I want to build a visualization
        -I think I can use these papers to get an idea of how to prepare my data
    -given these papers I think I should:
        -introduce a 1 week lag between my weather and covid data
        -start with temperature, absolute humidity and change in temperature
        -roll up cases and temp data to weekly averages
            -work with weeks and not days
-looked at flu visualizations
    -cdc
-WeatherSource for weather data
