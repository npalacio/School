things to have up:
-what is software assurance
    -security touchpoints
-requirements for SSE
    -slides with problem/abuse frame notations
-slides with assurance case notations

Notes:
-companies in OSS
    -used for non-differentiating technologies
    -leverage development model
        -all the benefit for 1/X the development cost
-SSE, Systems Security Engineering (the framework)
    -knowing your assets and engineering to protect against their loss are the focal points of systems security engineering
    -SSE must provide evidence of security
    -system = set of interacting elements organized to achieve a purpose
    -stakeholders define the value of an asset in the context of its loss
    -protection not only implies prevention but: detection, recovery, prediction of asset loss
    -active protection = explicit security functionality whose behavior satisfies security requirements
    -passive protection = environment of execution (architecture, design)
    -Framework
        -problem context
            -define security requirements
        -solution context
            -solve for security requirements
        -trustworthiness context
            -demonstrate that system is adequately secure
-requirements for SSE
    -difference between stakeholder (business) requirements and system requirements
        -stakeholder requirements are typically about the environment
        -system requirements are about the machine
